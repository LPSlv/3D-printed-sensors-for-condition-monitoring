A sensor was developed with trace width of 1.6 mm, an active length of 12 mm, and a single end loop. The sensor thickness was maintained at 0.6 mm for the active part and 0.1 mm for the base. Theoretically, this sensor can measure frequencies up to 13.6 kHz and has an electrical resistance of approximately 4.2 kΩ in an unstressed state.

Two different materials were used to manufacture the sensors:

1. **Proto-Pasta Conductive PLA** for the electrically conductive part of the sensor.
2. **Colorfabb PLA** for the electrically non-conductive base part.

**Printing Parameters**:

- **Layer height**: 0.3 mm
- **Infill**: 100%
- **Printing temperature**: 230°C
- **Printing speed**: 200 mm/s
- **Perimeter walls**: 2
- **Bed temperature**: 50°C

Other settings were selected based on printer defaults or material manufacturer recommendations.
